# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure

### Introduction
For this project, you will write a Packer template and a Terraform template to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository

2. Create your infrastructure as code

3. Update this README to reflect how someone would use your code.

### Dependencies
1. Create an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com) 
2. Install the [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
3. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)
4. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Instructions
**Your words here**
This project contain a packer template, terraform template for creating virtual machines.

####Packer template####
this packer template create a server image  with Linux OS (Ubuntu 18.04-LTS). 
***How to use the packer template to create an image ***
1.Clone this repository.
2.Set the working directory to where the template is.
3.Run the command "packer build server.json" to create the image.
4.Run the command "az image list" to see the image created.

####terraform template
Terraform template is mainly making Virtual Machines and associated resources. in terraform template/module, there is 3 files "main.tf", "vars.tf", "solution.plan".
'main.tf' is the main script which describes the resources to be created. 'vars.tf' file contains the variables that used in 'main.tf' script.You can change the variable values by changing default values for each variable in the 'vars.tf'. You can also add a deafult value for the variable 'num_vms',which is not specified now. 'solution.plan' is the file where terraform plan is saved for creating 2 VMs.

***How to use the terraform template to create an image ***
1.Clone this repository.
2.Set the working directory to where the template is.
3.Run the command "terraform init" to get started.
4.Run the command "terraform plan", if you want to save the plan add sub command "-out <filename>.
5.Run the command "terraform apply", if the plan is saved in a file then run "terraform apply "<filename>".
6.To see the deployed resources run "terraform show".
7.You can destroy the resources created by terraform using the command "terraform destroy".


### Output

We can check the output of these codes by running following commands
**az image list** to see the output produced by packer.
**terraform show** to see the output produced by terraform.
